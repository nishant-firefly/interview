1. Indexing:
Data Organization: Elasticsearch organizes data into indices, which are logical containers for related documents. Each index is associated with a mapping that defines the data structure and settings for fields within documents.
Mappings: A mapping specifies the data type of each field (e.g., text, keyword, date), along with settings such as analyzers, indexing options, and store options. Analyzers control how text is processed during indexing and querying (e.g., tokenization, stemming, stop words removal).
Document Indexing: To index a document, you send a PUT or POST request to Elasticsearch with a JSON document. Elasticsearch parses the document, applies the mapping, and stores it in the appropriate index.
2. Querying:
Query DSL (Domain-Specific Language): Elasticsearch provides a rich Query DSL for constructing various types of queries:
Match Query: Searches for documents that contain a specified text in one or more fields. You can customize match queries with options like fuzziness, operator, and minimum should match.
Term Query: Matches documents where a specified field exactly matches a specified term value.
Bool Query: Combines multiple queries using boolean operators (must, should, must_not) to create complex search criteria.
Range Query: Matches documents where a specified field falls within a specified numeric or date range.
Full-text Search: Elasticsearch supports full-text search by analyzing text during indexing and querying. This includes tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, and relevance scoring based on factors like term frequency and inverse document frequency.
3. Scoring:
Relevance Scoring: Elasticsearch calculates a relevance score for each document based on how well it matches the search query. The scoring algorithm considers factors such as term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), field length normalization, and any custom boost factors.
TF-IDF and BM25: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a classic scoring algorithm that evaluates the importance of a term in a document relative to its frequency across all documents. BM25 (Best Matching 25) is an enhanced version of TF-IDF that also considers document length and term frequency saturation for more accurate scoring.
4. Sorting and Pagination:
Sorting: Elasticsearch allows you to sort search results based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order. Sorting can be applied to numeric, date, or keyword fields.
Pagination: To handle large result sets, Elasticsearch supports pagination by allowing you to specify the size of each page and the starting offset. This helps in efficiently navigating through result pages.
5. Highlighting:
Search Result Highlighting: Elasticsearch provides highlighting capabilities to emphasize matching terms within the retrieved documents. Highlighting makes it easier for users to understand why a document is considered relevant to their query.
